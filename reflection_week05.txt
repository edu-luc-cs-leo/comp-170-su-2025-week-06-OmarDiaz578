For week 05 my main mistake was not giving myself enough time. The assignment was rushed 
and my code didn't pass majority of the tests. I also had print statements in my code
which were uneccesary. Overall, time management was my biggest flaw when it came to the last assignment.
My notes can still become even more detailed then they already are. My type hints still need some work too.
I do think there are many more areas I can improve on. I know I can do things more efficiantly than I have in the past.
To make my code more efficient I will practice doing just that, 
finding ways to make code as efficient as possible, not just write it.
